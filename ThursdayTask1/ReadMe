ðŸ§© Assignment 1: Real-Time Price Ticker Using Channels
Concepts to Use:
goroutine
channel
select
time.Sleep or ticker
Problem Statement:
Simulate a live stock price feed using channels. You are given a list of tickers with simulated prices. Each stock ticker sends a new price every second. Your job is to print the updates to console in real-time.
Expected Behavior:
Create a goroutine per ticker
Use a channel to send price updates
Use select to print them as they arrive
Sample Input:
go
CopyEdit
tickers := []string{"AAPL", "GOOG", "INFY"}
Sample Output (randomized per ticker):
yaml
CopyEdit
[10:01:01] AAPL: 172.56
[10:01:01] GOOG: 2875.22
[10:01:01] INFY: 1400.03
[10:01:02] AAPL: 172.60
[10:01:02] INFY: 1400.08
...
